# Processing image data with OpenCV and controlling Kiwi using Python

This Python-template demonstrates how to develop a software module to process video data (eg., image detection, etc.) and to control Kiwi.

Prerequisites:
* [You need to install Docker for your platform](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/#install-docker-ce)
* [You need to install `docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
* You have successfully completed the _Getting started_ tutorials [here](https://github.com/chalmers-revere/opendlv-tutorial-kiwi/tree/master).
* You have a recording file (`.rec`) with some video frames.
* You need to install `libcluon` (example below is for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS):
```Bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chrberger/libcluon
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcluon
```
* You need to install Python, make, protobuf, and OpenCV (example below is for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS):
```Bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    python3-protobuf \
    python3-sysv-ipc \
    python3-numpy \
    python3-opencv \
    protobuf-compiler
```

## Developing and testing the Python application on your laptop using replay mode

This template folder contains an example how to use Python to process data residing in a shared memory area using OpenCV for image processing.

* Step 1: Assuming that you have a folder `~/kiwi-recordings`, where you have at least one `.rec` file with included video.

* Step 2: Clone this repository (if it was done already in the C++ tutorial, then skip command #2):
```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/chalmers-revere/opendlv-tutorial-kiwi.git
cd opendlv-tutorial-kiwi/opendlv-perception-helloworld-python
```

* Step 3: The Python script uses messages from the OpenDLV Standard Message Set. To use them with Python, just run:
```bash
make
```
This step needs to be repeated whenever you change something in the message specifications.

* Step 4: Now, you can start the h264 replay and web app as follows (the actual h264 replay microservice is built once during the first call). Remember to change the filename to a file that exists in `~/kiwi-recordings`. The replay will start automatically when the program starts, including a video stream put in shared memory, and you can use the web app to see data UDP multicast data. You should see a video running on your screen before continuing.

```bash
docker-compose -f h264-replay-viewer.yml up
```


* Step 4: Open another terminal. Then run the Python (note that you need version 3) module from the folder `opendlv-perception-helloworld-python`:
```bash
cd opendlv-tutorial-kiwi/opendlv-perception-helloworld-python
python3 opendlv-perception-helloworld.py
```

The application should start and wait for images to come in. Furthermore, the code also display all other sensor values from the recording file, and the code example show how these messages can be parsed.

You can stop the Python application by pressing `Ctrl-C`. When you are modifying the Python application, repeat step 4 after any change to your software.

## Deploying and testing the Python application in Kiwi simulation

* Step 1: Have the previous tutorial completed.

* Step 2: Start the simulation as described in section 3.1.

* Step 3: Open another terminal. Then run the Python (note that you need version 3) module from the folder `opendlv-perception-helloworld-python`:
```bash
python3 opendlv-perception-helloworld.py
```

The application should start and wait for images to come in. Furthermore, the code also display all other sensor values from the recording file, and the code example show how these messages can be parsed. You can also send actuation signals, as exemplified in the code, to steer the simulated robot.

You can stop your software component by pressing `Ctrl-C`. When you are modifying the software component, repeat step 3 after any change to your software.

## Deploying and testing the Python application on Kiwi

After you have completed your development locally and you are ready for testing on Kiwi, you need to package the software into a Docker image.

* Step 1: Have the previous tutorial completed.

* Step 2: **Make sure that you commented all debug windows from OpenCV as there won't be a GUI available on Kiwi.''

* Step 3: Don't forget to change the CID from 253 (used for replay mode) to 112 (used on Kiwi) so that the messages that you are sending are processed properly.

* Step 4: Build the Docker image (don't forget the trailing `.`). The first time build process can take a while:
```Bash
docker build -t myapp -f Dockerfile.armhf .
```

* Step 5: Next, save the created Docker image to a file:
```Bash
docker save myapp > myapp.tar
```

* Step 6: Now, you copy the Docker image to Kiwi (the upload can take a few minutes):
```Bash
scp -P 2200 myapp.tar pi@192.168.8.1:~
```

* Step 7: Your application image is now on Kiwi; next, login to Kiwi to start it:
```Bash
ssh -p 2200 pi@192.168.8.1
```

* Step 8: Assuming that the Getting Started Tutorial 2 (Controlling Kiwi using your web browser) is still running, you can load your application into Docker and start it:
```Bash
docker load < myapp.tar
docker run --rm -ti --init --ipc=host --net=host -v /tmp:/tmp myapp:latest 
```

When everything has worked correctly, you should see a message of type opendlv.proxy.AngleReading in the message overview of the web application.

### Updating your Python application on Kiwi

After you have completed your development locally and you are ready for testing on Kiwi, you need to package the software into a Docker image.

* Step 1: Have the previous tutorial completed.

* Step 2: **Make sure that you commented all debug windows from OpenCV as there won't be a GUI available on Kiwi.''

* Step 3: Don't forget to change the CID from 253 (used for replay mode) to 112 (used on Kiwi) so that the messages that you are sending are processed properly.

* Step 4: Copy your application opendlv-perception-helloworld.py to Kiwi:
```Bash
scp -P 2200 opendlv-perception-helloworld.py pi@192.168.8.1:~
```

* Step 5: Your application image is now on Kiwi; next, login to Kiwi to start it:
```Bash
ssh -p 2200 pi@192.168.8.1
```

* Step 6: Assuming that the Getting Started Tutorial 2 (Controlling Kiwi using your web browser) is still running, you can load your application into Docker and start it:
```Bash
docker run --rm -ti --init --ipc=host --net=host -v /tmp:/tmp -v $HOME/opendlv-perception-helloworld.py:/opt/sources/opendlv-perception-helloworld.py myapp:latest
```
The parameter `-v $HOME/opendlv-perception-helloworld.py:/opt/sources/opendlv-perception-helloworld.py` is mapping your Python application into the running Docker container and thus, replacing the one that is contained in the Docker image. If you need more files to run your application (e.g., `.xml` files), simply add further parameters like `-v $HOME/myFile.xml:/opt/sources/myFile.xml` before the past part of the previous command `myapp:latest`.
