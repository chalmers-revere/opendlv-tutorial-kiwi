# Processing image data with OpenCV and controlling Kiwi using C++

This C++-template demonstrates how to develop a software module to process video data (eg., image detection, etc.) to be used with Kiwi.

Prerequisites:
* [You need to install Docker for your platform](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/#install-docker-ce)
* [You need to install `docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
* You have successfully completed the _Getting started_ tutorials [here](https://github.com/chalmers-revere/opendlv-tutorial-kiwi/tree/master).
* You have a recording file (`.rec`) with some video frames.

---

## Building and testing the software module for your laptop (replay mode)

This template folder contains everything you need to compile and run a C++ software component that uses OpenCV for image processing. We are using Docker to build and run the resulting binary.

* Step 1: Assuming that you have a folder `~/kiwi-recordings`, where you have at least one `.rec` file from your experiments with Kiwi.

* Step 2: Clone this repository (if it was done already in the Python tutorial, then skip command #2):
```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/chalmers-revere/opendlv-tutorial-kiwi.git
cd opendlv-tutorial-kiwi/opendlv-perception-helloworld-cpp
```

* Step 3: Next, you enable access to your X11 server (GUI; necessary once per login):
```bash
xhost +
```

* Step 4: Now, you can start the h264 replay and web app for replaying as follows (the actual h264 replay is built once during the first call). Remember to change the filename to a file that exists in `~/kiwi-recordings`. The replay will start automatically when the program starts, including a video stream put in shared memory, and you can use the web app to see data UDP multicast data.
```bash
docker-compose -f h264-replay-viewer.yml up
```

* Step 5: Open another terminal. Then, assuming that you are located in the `opendlv-perception-helloworld-cpp` folder, you can build the software module as follows:
```bash
docker build -t myapp .
```

* Step 6: Now, you can run your software component:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti --init --net=host --ipc=host -v /tmp:/tmp -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY myapp --cid=111 --name=img.argb --width=1280 --height=720 --verbose
```

The application should start and wait for images to come in. Furthermore, the code also display all other sensor values from the recording file, and the code example show how these messages can be parsed.

You can stop your software component by pressing `Ctrl-C`. When you are modifying the software component, repeat step 5 and step 6 after any change to your software.

After a while, you might have collected a lot of unused Docker images on your machine. You can remove them by running:
```bash
for i in $(docker images|tr -s " " ";"|grep "none"|cut -f3 -d";"); do docker rmi -f $i; done
```

## Deploying and testing the C++ application in Kiwi simulation

* Step 1: Have the previous tutorial completed.

* Step 2: Start the simulation as described in section 3.1.

* Step 3: Open another terminal. Then, assuming that you are located in the `opendlv-perception-helloworld-cpp` folder, you can build the software module as follows:
```bash
docker build -t myapp .
```

* Step 4: Now, you can run your software component:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti --init --net=host --ipc=host -v /tmp:/tmp -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY myapp --cid=111 --name=video0.argb --width=1280 --height=720 --verbose
```

The application should start and wait for images to come in. Furthermore, the code also display all other sensor values from the recording file, and the code example show how these messages can be parsed. You can also send actuation signals, as exemplified in the code, to steer the simulated robot.

You can stop your software component by pressing `Ctrl-C`. When you are modifying the software component, repeat step 3 and step 4 after any change to your software.

After a while, you might have collected a lot of unused Docker images on your machine. You can remove them by running:
```bash
for i in $(docker images|tr -s " " ";"|grep "none"|cut -f3 -d";"); do docker rmi -f $i; done
```

## Deploying and testing the C++ application on Kiwi

When you are ready to test the features and performance of your software component on Kiwi in live mode, you need to build the software component for `armhf`. Therefore, you will find a file named `Dockerfile.armhf` in this template folder that describes the necessary steps to build your software component for `armhf`.  

* Step 1: Have the previous tutorial completed.

* Step 2: **Make sure that you commented all debug windows from OpenCV as there won't be a GUI available on Kiwi.''

* Step 3: Assuming that you are located in the `opendlv-perception-helloworld-cpp` folder, you can build the software module for `armhf` as follows:
```bash
docker build -t myapp.armhf -f Dockerfile.armhf .
```

* Step 4: After having successfully built the software component and packaged it into a Docker image for `armhf`, you need to transfer this Docker image from your laptop to Kiwi. Therefore, you save the Docker image to a file:
```bash
docker save myapp.armhf > myapp.armhf.tar
```

* Step 5: Next, you copy the image to Kiwi's *Raspberry Pi* using secure copy (`scp`):
```bash
scp -P 2200 myapp.armhf.tar pi@192.168.8.1:~
```

* Step 6: Afterwards, you log in to Kiwi's *Raspberry Pi* and load the Docker image:
```Bash
ssh -p 2200Â pi@192.168.8.1
cat myapp.armhf.tar | docker load
```

* Step 7: Assuming that the Getting Started Tutorial 2 (Controlling Kiwi using your web browser) is still running, you can finally run your software component next to other microservices on Kiwi's *Raspberry Pi*:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti --init --net=host --ipc=host -v /tmp:/tmp myapp.armhf --cid=112 --name=img.argb --width=640 --height=480
```

Alternatively, you can also modify a `.yml` file from the Getting Started tutorial to include your software component:
```yml
    myapp:
        container_name: myapp
        image: myapp.armhf
        restart: on-failure
        network_mode: "host"
        ipc: "host"
        volumes:
        - /tmp:/tmp
        command: "--cid=112 --name=img.argb --width=640 --height=480"
```
